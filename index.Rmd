Microbes control the world! And with advances in molecular techniques, esp. DNA sequencing, we can explore the microbial side with ever increasing depth and breadth. But the data generated by sequencing the microbial world is bigish and weird. Most bioinformatic tools don't handle the taxonomic markers that we like to sequence very well. There are a few specialized programs for processing taxonomic sequences, we will be using mothur <http://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP>. Later this week, we'll take the OTU table (species by sample matrix) into R to explore the data and learn how to make publication quality figures.
